<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a PhD student in [the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.northeastern.edu/) at Northeastern University. My primary research interests include Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) Systems, Computer Networks, Wireless Sensing and Communications, Mobile and Wearable Computing. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [chen.guod@northeastern.edu](mailto:chen.guod@northeastern.edu).

At Northeastern University, I'm fortunate to work as a member of Spatial Internet Research Group (SINRG) led by Professor [Mallesham Dasari](https://mallesham.com/).

# 💡 Research

I am going to explore the future of immersive media and do something cool to shape the future of communication! Currently, I mainly focus on AR/VR, 3D Mesh/Point Cloud compression, and spatial/volumetric video streaming. I am also interested in AI-based 3D content compression and streaming technologies.
